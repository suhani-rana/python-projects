# python-projects

Hi, I’m Suhani — a BCA student learning Python and cybersecurity.  
This repo is where I keep small, practical Python projects and scripts I build while practising.

I try to work on one small thing every week: something that helps me learn a new concept or solve a tiny problem.  
Mostly I focus on basics first (loops, functions, file handling) and then move to simple automation and mini tools.
